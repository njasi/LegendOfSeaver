About The Level Editor:

    Creating levels with this program is divided into different stages such at tile placement
    and obstructions. You can change stages using the editor bar at the top of the screen or with key board shortcuts.
    
    Stage 0 Tiles (Shift+T): 
        In this stage you place down all of the visual tiles such as ground, walls, or water.
        -To select tiles use the arrow keys to move the selector on the sidebar on the right
        -Pressing R will rotate the tile's orientation for when you place it.
        -You can also use a fill feature by holding control+f while you place a tile
        -You can fill in the area of a rectangle by holding alt and clicking two oppisite corners of said rectangle
        
    Stage 1 Decorations (Shift+P):
        Decorations are any tiles that are partly clear and are meant to keep the background of the tile under it
        EX: you are able to place a desk ontop of the floor and still see the floor.
        -Once again use the sidebar to select what you want to place.
        -Click to place a decoration.
        -Use R to rotate .
        -use alt and click corners to fill a rectangle.
        -To remove a decoration hold control and click it.
        
    Stage 2 Obstructions(Shift+O):
        Obstructions are things that the player runs into, like a wall. There are different kinds of obstructions 
        that can be used which have a different hitbox, such as wedges.
        -Click to place an obstruction.
        -To switch obstruction types use the arrow keys.
        -Use R to rotate the obstruction.
        -Control click on an obstruction to remove it.
        -While holding alt you can fill a rectangle like with normal tiles.
    
    Stage 3 Doors(Shift+D):
        Doors are one of the things the connect screens together. Say you have a building in a screen and you want 
        make it so you can go inside, if you create another screen for the inside you can place a door to link the two levels.
        -Click to place a door, the creator will ask if you want to place multiple doors. This is for if you have
         a two wide doorway. If you say yes you can place more. When you are done, control click to finish placing the doors.
         It will then ask you to select the level that the doors go to. Choose the destination and click to place the doors.
        -To remove a door, click on it. This works while you are placing down multiple doors too
        
    Stage 4 Monsters(Shift+M):
        Monsters are the monsters. come on I can't really make this any clearer.
        -Click to place a monster.
        -Press control+M to bring up a searchbar to find a monster. If you want to display all do a blank search
        -control click on a monster (or stack of monsters) to edit their properties. You will also be given the option to
         delete them.
